## üßê | Project Task <a name="project-task"></a>

We should implement Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K-Means, and a simple Neural Network using the Python programming language. The detailed requirements for each model are included in their respective files.

    
## ‚ÑπÔ∏è | Context & Datasets <a name="context-datasets"></a>

Different datasets are used for various machine learning models in this assignment. Each dataset serves a specific purpose in building and evaluating different types of models.

### **Vehicle Dataset (Linear Regression)**
This dataset from Cardekho consists of 302 instances with 8 features each. It is used for linear regression, aiming to predict a single target variable.

### **Titanic Dataset (Logistic Regression)**
This dataset contains passenger information from the ill-fated RMS Titanic voyage of 1912. It is used for logistic regression, primarily for binary classification tasks like predicting survival.

### **Iris Dataset (K-Means)**
This dataset consists of measurements of sepal and petal length for three different iris species (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica). It contains 150 data points and is suitable for K-means clustering exercises.

### **Breast Cancer Dataset (Neural Network)**
This dataset is used for binary classification tasks related to breast cancer diagnosis. It provides various features relevant to the diagnostic process.
